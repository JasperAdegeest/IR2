# Large-scale Validation of Deep Learning for Logged Bandit Feedback

## Paper

The paper of this reseach can be found in the main folder of the repository.

## Data

Our experiments are conducted on the Criteo dataset, which can be obtained via (http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~adith/Criteo/).

## NeuralBLBF

The contributions of our paper can be found in the NeuralBLBF folder. To train and test a model, the __main__.py file can be used. The following models are available for usage:
* TinyEmbedFFNN
* SmallEmbedFFNN
* LargeEmbedFFNN
* SparseFFNN
* SparseLinear
* CrossNetwork

## POEM and Scripts

The baseline results of the paper: Large-scale Validation of Counterfactual Learning Methods
A Test-Bed by Lefortier et al. can be replicated with the POEM and Scripts folder. The code was obtained via the papers related website (http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~adith/Criteo/).
The website contains a detailed explanation how the baseline results from the paper can be reproduced.
